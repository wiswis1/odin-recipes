    <p>This is a foolproof recipe for cooking Jollof rice, West Africaâ€™s most popular dish. I like to serve it as a main with stewed chicken and fried plantains.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients(Adjust according to servings)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The main ingredient in Jollof rice is, of course, <strong>rice</strong>. I used long-grain parboiled rice for this recipe.</li>
        <li>Next up are the 1 <strong>canned tomato paste</strong>,2 <strong>fresh tomatoes</strong>, 2 <strong>bell peppers</strong> , 1 <strong>scotch bonnet</strong> add more if you want more spice,
            2 <strong>onions</strong>, 1 <strong>garlic</strong> , and 1 <strong>ginger</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Oil</strong>, I use vegetable oil for my recipe.</li>
        <li><Strong>Stock</Strong> - Chicken, beef or vegetable stock are great choices to add more flavor to the dish.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasoning</strong> and herbs - curry powder, salt, black/white pepper, boullion powder, thyme and bay leaves.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>NB:</strong> blend the fresh tomatoes, bell peppers, scotch bonnet, and onions into a blender and make a pepper mix, and set aside</li>
        <li>Start by adding your oil and <strong>sauteing the Onions</strong> on medium heat. This should take about 3 to 5 minutes until the onions are soft. 
            Then add in tomato paste and stir for another 4 mins.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the ginger and garlic</strong> and cook along the tomato paste for another two minutes ,this should produce a smell. 
            Try not to cook for longer unless you might burn them</li>
        <li><strong>Add the blended peppers</strong>, usually fry for about 15 to 20 mins, or until you see oil floating at the top of your sauce. At this point the sauce no longer smells like the raw pepper mix you blended</li>
        <li>Finally, in building my flavor, I <strong>add the thyme, curry powder, salt, black/white pepper (optional), and seasoning cubes</strong>. Adjust the seasoning at this point if there is a need to</li>
        <li>Once the flavor is good for me, then, I <strong>stir in the Rice</strong>. Make sure the rice is properly covered by the sauce.</li>
        <li>Now <strong>add your choice of stock</strong>. Give it a brief stir and cover it up with a tight-fitting lid. 
            This is because it needs a lot of steam to cook properly. Use foil paper to cover the pot before adding a lid if it is not tight fitting enough.</li>
        <li>Once the rice comes to a boil, <strong>reduce the heat to medium-low</strong> immediately and continue to <strong>cook until the rice is done, about 20 to 30 minutes</strong>. 
            If rice is too hard, add water to make sure the rice is cooked.</li>
        <li>Serve with fried chicken, fried beef or any protein of your choice and plantains</li>
    </ol>
